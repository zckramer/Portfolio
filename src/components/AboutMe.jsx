            <p id='About-Me__Text'>Since 2014 I have been studying video game design, and looking for employment in an Agile, and 
        TDD based environment. I began my journey by attending Full Sail University's online Video Game Design 
        program where I learned C#, and practiced video game development in Unity. After graduating in 2017, 
        earning a Bachelors degree of Science, I studied JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my spare time. When I was 
        met with competition in my job search, I decided to update my skills set and get training in full stack 
        development by attending We Can Code IT, in the fall of 2019. I graduated December 11th, 2019 with a
        certification in Software Development.</p>
